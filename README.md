# Side-Hustle

First sprint which connected communication between Jira's REST API and our local database in which we access projects directly from Jira and import them into our application for the purpose of creating multiple tickets at one time for your Jira Project.

The ultimate goal of this app is to shave time off issue creation when managing a project with Jira. You will be able to create as many Epics, Stories, and Sub-tasks needed and submit them to Jira at one time. Additonal features to come are dynamic project creation and data analytics.
